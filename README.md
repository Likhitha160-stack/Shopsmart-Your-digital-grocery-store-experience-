Technical Architecture:-

 





The technical architecture of an grocery-webapp app typically involves a client-server model, where the frontend represents the client and the backend serves as the server. The frontend is responsible for user interface, interaction, and presentation, while the backend handles data storage, business logic, and integration with external services like payment gateways and databases. Communication between the frontend and backend is typically facilitated through APIs, enabling seamless data exchange and functionality.

PRE REQUISITES:              

 To develop a full-stack Ecommerce App for Furniture Tool using React js, Node.js,Express js and MongoDB, there are several prerequisites you should consider. Here are the key prerequisites for developing such an application: 

Node.js and npm: Install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager), on your development machine. Node.js is required to run JavaScript on the server side. 

• Download: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

• Installation instructions:https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/



MongoDB: Set up a MongoDB database to store hotel and booking information. Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service. 

• Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community  

• Installation instructions:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ 



Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. Install Express.js to handle server-side routing, middleware, and API development. 

• Installation: Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following

   command: npm install express 



React js: React is a JavaScript library for building client-side applications. 

 And Creating Single Page Web-Appliaction





Getting Started

Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.



Quik  Start

npm create vite@latest

cd my-app

npm install

npm run dev





If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.





Create a new React project: 

• Choose or create a directory where you want to set up your React project. 

• Open your terminal or command prompt. 

• Navigate to the selected directory using the cd command. 



• Create a new React project by running the following command: npx create-react-app your-app-name.Wait for the project to be created: 

• This command will generate the basic project structure and install the necessary dependencies 



Navigate into the project directory: 

• After the project creation is complete, navigate into the project directory by running the following command: cd your-app-name 



Start the development server: 

• To launch the development server and see your React app in the browser, run the following command:  npm run dev 

• The npm start  will compile your app and start the development server. 

• Open your web browser and navigate to https://localhost:5173 to see your React app. 



You have successfully set up React on your machine and created a new React project. You can now start building your app by modifying the generated project files in the src directory.



Please note that these instructions provide a basic setup for React. You can explore more ad- vanced configurations and features by referring to the official  React documentation: https://react.dev/

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Basic knowledge of HTML for creating the structure of your app, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity is essential. 



Database Connectivity: Use a MongoDB driver or an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library like Mongoose to connect your Node.js server with the MongoDB database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.



Front-end Library: Utilize React  to build the user-facing part of the application, including products listings, booking forms, and user interfaces for the admin dashboard. 



Version Control: Use Git for version control, enabling collaboration and tracking changes throughout the development process. Platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket can host your repository. 

• Git: Download and installation instructions can be found at: https://git-scm.com/downloads  



Development Environment: Choose a code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that suits your preferences, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or WebStorm. 

• Visual Studio Code: Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/download 

• Sublime Text: Download from

 https://www.sublimetext.com/download 

• WebStorm: Download from https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download
